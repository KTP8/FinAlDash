        <br><br>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Familiarise yourself with the market analytics and the key indices which influence your investment success and financial wisdom.</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> Market analytics involve analysing various data points to understand market trends and 
            make informed investment decisions. Key indices such as the FTSE 100, FTSE 250, 
            and the MSCI World Index are essential for tracking market performance. Changes in these 
            financial markets can often be seen to align with major economic announcements and/or geopolitical events.

            <p>Different market conditions, including economic growth, inflation, and interest rates, influence investment strategies. 
                For instance, a high inflation environment might make bonds less attractive; pushing investors towards equities or commodities.
